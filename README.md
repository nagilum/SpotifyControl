# SpotifyControl

Tiny tray app to control common Spotify tasks with global hotkeys.

## Hotkeys

Play/pause: `Ctrl+Alt+Home`
Stop: `Ctrl+Alt+End`
Next track: `Ctrl+Alt+Page Down`
Previous track: `Ctrl+Alt+Page Up`
Volume Up: `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Up`
Volume Down: `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Down`

In a future release I might add customization of the hotkeys.
